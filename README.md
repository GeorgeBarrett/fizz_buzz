# fizz_buzz

this was a paired programming exercise. me and a fellow developer took the driving seat for 15 minutes at a time and completed a fizz buzz programme. we also wrote a test suite for the programme. we followed a test driven approach and spent time thinking about edge cases before writing the test suite first. we built the fizzbuzz programme afterwards.
